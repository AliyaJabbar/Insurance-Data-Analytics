### 🛠 **Tech Stack**

| Tool              | Purpose                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power BI**      | Visualizes data and builds interactive dashboard           |
| **MS SQL Server** | Stores, manages, and queries the structured insurance data |
| **Excel (CSV)**   | Original data source containing customer and policy info   |

These tools were chosen for their enterprise-level capabilities and their relevance in real-world data analysis workflows. The dashboard is fully compatible with organizational BI practices.

### 📊 **Data Source**

The project uses a **structured insurance dataset** that includes:

* Customer demographics (age, gender)
* Policy information (types, premiums, status)
* Claim history (amounts, claim status, active/inactive users)

The data was first loaded into **SQL Server** to perform structured queries and basic data cleaning. It was then connected to **Power BI**, where various DAX expressions, slicers, and chart types were used for in-depth analysis.

### 🌟 **Key Features / Highlights**

This dashboard provides:

* **Dynamic filtering** using slicers for Policy Number, Customer ID, and Claim Number.
* **KPI cards** to monitor key metrics at a glance:

  * Total Premium Amount
  * Total Claim Amount
  * Gender distribution
* **Powerful visuals** that tell a clear story:

  * **Ribbon Chart**: Displays claim statuses over time (Settled, Pending, Rejected)
  * **Area Chart**: Highlights age groups contributing most to claim amounts
  * **Donut Chart**: Tracks user activity (Active vs. Inactive)
  * **Stacked Bar Chart**: Shows premium revenue by policy type
  * **Pie Chart**: Breaks down policies by category
  * **Table**: Gives a clean summary of claims by type and status

All visual elements are **interactive**, helping users explore and analyze data from multiple angles in seconds.

### 🧠 **Business Problem**

In the insurance sector, data is abundant, but **turning that data into actionable insights** is often a challenge. Traditional spreadsheets make it difficult to:

* Track rejected claims in a timely way
* Detect which policies are underperforming
* Analyze customer engagement across demographics

This leads to **slow decision-making**, **inefficient targeting**, and **missed revenue opportunities**.

---

### 🎯 **Project Goal**

This project aims to:

* **Empower insurance teams** to make data-backed business decisions
* **Reduce time spent** on data cleaning and reporting
* **Improve visibility** into operational bottlenecks
* **Enhance customer insights** to improve policy targeting and satisfaction
* **Create a reusable BI tool** for monthly and quarterly review meetings

By using this dashboard, stakeholders no longer need to sift through complex Excel sheets — **the entire process of business reporting is streamlined and automated**.

### 👥 **Who Can Use This Project?**

This dashboard can be highly useful for:

* **Insurance analysts** who track KPIs and prepare reports
* **Operations managers** managing claim performance and fraud analysis
* **Sales and marketing teams** to identify high-value segments
* **Customer success teams** to improve retention strategies
* **Data science interns or students** learning business intelligence concepts
